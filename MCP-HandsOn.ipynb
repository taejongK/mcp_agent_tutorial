      "\"We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models\""

Such a move would mean going head-to-head with companies like MyFitnessPal and Noom, the report added.\\nAs Bloomberg noted, Apple’s health efforts have run into roadblocks in the past. For example, the company last year decided to remove a blood oxygen feature from its smartwatch following a yearslong patent dispute with medical technology firm Masimo.\\nIn other news from the intersection of AI and healthcare, a new PYMNTS Intelligence report — “Healthcare Firms Going Long on GenAI Investment” — finds that investments in this technology are yielding returns, leading to a wave of additional adoption by major players.\\nThe report is based on surveys of C-suite executives at healthcare firms with at least $1 billion in yearly revenue, with the goal of understanding their generative AI (GenAI) strategies.\\n“The findings indicate a strong conviction in the technology’s potential, with 9 in 10 executives anticipating a positive return on their GenAI investments,” PYMNTS wrote.\\n“Consequently, a majority of these leaders plan to further escalate their GenAI spending in the coming year, placing healthcare ahead of the cross-industry average in its bullish outlook.\\nThe report highlights the strategic prioritization of GenAI in crucial operational areas as businesses strive to stay competitive.\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\nRecommended\\nApple Reportedly Developing AI Agent 'Doctors' in Latest Health Push\\nUber and DoorDash Hope to Hitch Ride With GOP Tip Law\\nJapan Reportedly Could Place Crypto Under Insider Trading Rules\\nTariffs Could Reportedly Cost US Carmakers $10K per Vehicle\\nSee More In: AI, AI agents, AI healthcare, Apple, apple health, Apple Intelligence, Apple Watch, artificial intelligence, GenAI, generative AI, Healthcare, heatlh, News, Project Mulberry, Project Quartz, PYMNTS News, What's Hot\\nBlackstone Reportedly Weighs Investment in TikTok US\\nBy PYMNTS  |  March 30, 2025\\n|\\nThe private equity outfit Blackstone reportedly could soon be an investor in TikTok’s American operations.\\nThe company is considering a small minority investment in the social media platform, Reuters reported Friday (March 28), citing two sources familiar with the matter.\\nAccording to the report, Blackstone is weighing whether to join Chinese parent company ByteDance’s existing non-Chinese shareholders, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, in contributing fresh funding to bid for TikTok’s American unit. The group, the report added, has emerged as front-runners to take over TikTok.\\nTheir plan would spin off TikTok U.S. into a separate entity, winnowing down Chinese ownership in this new business to under 20%, the threshold mandated by U.S. law.\\nThe future of TikTok has been in limbo since last year, when Congress — driven by national security fears — passed a law requiring its Chinese parent company to divest or face a ban.\\nThe law gave ByteDance until January 19 of this year to divest. That deadline came and went with no decision, and TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. However, the site quickly returned to life when President Donald Trump said he would give ByteDance more time.\\nThe new deadline is just days away — April 5 — though Trump has said he could extend it even further. The Reuters report noted that Vice President JD Vance has said he expects a deal to be reached in time for the deadline.\\nAmong the other potential bidders for TikTok is the artificial intelligence (AI) search engine firm Perplexity. This month, the company made its case for why it should become the site’s new owner, following weeks of reports that the company was interested in merging with TikTok.\\n“Perplexity is singularly positioned to rebuild the TikTok algorithm without creating a monopoly, combining world-class technical capabilities with Little Tech independence,” the company wrote on its blog.\\n“Any acquisition by a consortium of investors could in effect keep ByteDance in control of the algorithm, while any acquisition by a competitor would likely create a monopoly in the short form video and information space. All of society benefits when content feeds are liberated from the manipulations of foreign governments and globalist monopolists.”\\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence has shown TikTok’s role as a driver of social commerce, with 20% of retail shoppers saying they are influenced by written content they encounter on it and other platforms.\\n“When you rarely leave the house, whoever’s showing up on your phone will have a lot of sway,” PYMNTS wrote earlier this year. “TikTok isn’t just a platform for showcasing boxed-in dance moves — it’s an economic force within the hermitage.”\\nRecommended\\nBlackstone Reportedly Weighs Investment in TikTok US\\nReport: DOGE Aims to Rebuild Social Security Database\\nApple Reportedly Developing AI Agent 'Doctors' in Latest Health Push\\nUber and DoorDash Hope to Hitch Ride With GOP Tip Law\\nSee More In: blackstone, Bytedance, News, private equity, PYMNTS News, social commerce, Social Media, TikTok, TikTok ban, What's Hot\\nTrending News\\nBlackstone Reportedly Weighs Investment in TikTok US\\nDOGE Plans to Update Outdated SSA Coding Language\\nApple Reportedly Developing AI Agent 'Doctors' in Latest Health Push\\nThe Big Story\\nExperience Economy Meets Hollywood: Live Events Redefine Movie, Streaming Engagement\\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\\nFeatured News\\nSEC Roundtable Reveals Cautious Approach to GenAI Adoption in Finance\\nBest-in-Class Issuers Use Seven Strategies to Boost Customer Lifetime Value, Study Finds\\nVersatile Credit CEO: Economic Uncertainty Drives Pay-Later Merchant Benefits\\nSingapore’s Small Businesses Know the Score With Digital Wallets for Cross-Border Payments\\nFraud Uncertainty Climbs to 28%, Disrupting Operations for Mid-Market Firms\\nUtila CEO: ‘Everyone Will Enter the Stablecoin Era’\\nFinTech IPO Index Slips 1.3% as Huize Sinks After Earnings\\nSubscribe\\nPYMNTS Today\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nCryptocurrency\\nB2B\\nDigital Transformation\\nSUBSCRIBELoading...\\nAn error occurred.

Nvidia, a key player in the AI revolution, has seen massive investor enthusiasm in recent years, fueled by expectations of soaring demand for its advanced chips.

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\\n✕\\nDo not sell or share my personal information.\\nYou have chosen to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your information from this site and any of its affiliates.

      "DeepSeek-R1은 DeepSeek-R1-Zero의 단점을 해결하고 추론 성능을 더욱 향상시키기 위해 개발되었습니다. DeepSeek-R1은 RL을 사용하기 전에 다단계 훈련 및 cold-start 데이터를 활용합니다.\n",

      "**학습 방법:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cold-Start:** RL 훈련의 초기 불안정한 cold-start 단계를 방지하기 위해 DeepSeek-R1은 소량의 long CoT 데이터를 수집하고 모델을 미세 조정합니다.  long CoT 데이터는 few-shot 프롬프팅, 상세 답변 생성 프롬프팅, DeepSeek-R1-Zero 출력 재구성, 사람의 후처리 등의 방법으로 수집됩니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **강화 학습 (RL):** DeepSeek-R1은 강화 학습을 통해 추론 능력을 향상시킵니다. 특히 코딩, 수학, 과학 및 논리 추론과 같은 추론 집약적인 작업에 중점을 둡니다. RL 훈련 중 언어 혼합 문제를 완화하기 위해 언어 일관성 보상을 도입합니다. 이 보상은 CoT에서 대상 언어 단어의 비율로 계산됩니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Distillation:** DeepSeek-R1은 추론 능력을 소형 모델로 증류하는 데 사용됩니다. DeepSeek-R1을 교사 모델로 사용하여 800K 훈련 샘플을 생성하고 여러 소형 모델을 미세 조정합니다.\n",
      "\n",
      "**결론:**\n",
      "\n",
      "DeepSeek-R1은 Cold-Start 데이터와 강화 학습을 결합하여 뛰어난 추론 능력을 달성한 모델입니다. DeepSeek-R1은 다양한 작업에서 OpenAI-o1-1217과 비슷한 성능을 보여줍니다.\n",
